# Powercord Install Script
Auto-installs powercord for Windows (tested on git bash), Linux (Not Tested Yet), and MacOS (Not Tested Yet).

## Usage
Just run `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TheOddGarlic/powercord-install/master/pc-install.sh | sh`. I've heard that newer installs of Git for Windows does not include curl so you might have to install it. 

## Works On
